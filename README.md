## Sentiment Analysis on Textual Data Using NLP
## Objective
To perform sentiment analysis on textual data (e.g., tweets, product reviews) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, identifying whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Tools & Technologies
NLP Libraries: NLTK, spaCy, TextBlob, Transformers (Hugging Face)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/ PyTorch for model implementation.
Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation.
## Key Steps in Analysis
## Data Collection

Collect textual data (tweets, reviews) from relevant sources using APIs (e.g., Twitter API) or pre-existing datasets.
## Data Preprocessing

Text Cleaning: Remove stop words, punctuation, URLs, and non-alphanumeric characters.
Tokenization: Convert text into tokens (words or phrases).
Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root form (e.g., “running” -> “run”).
Vectorization: Convert text into numerical format (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT embeddings).
## Sentiment Model Implementation

Traditional Approach: Use Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM for classification.
Deep Learning Approach: Implement transformer models like BERT or DistilBERT for more accurate sentiment classification.
Model Evaluation

Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Fine-tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Insights Extraction

Visualize sentiment distribution using matplotlib/seaborn.
Generate key insights based on sentiment trends, e.g., positive/negative sentiment over time or towards specific keywords.
## Deliverable
Jupyter Notebook showcasing:
Data preprocessing steps (cleaning, tokenization, vectorization).
Model implementation (training and evaluation).
Sentiment analysis insights and visualizations.
